    "# Introduction to Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will go over the basics of Recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is recursion  \n",
    "Recursion is a way of programming or coding a problem, in which a function calls itself one or more times within its' body and the function must terminate.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "If a function definition fulfils this condition, we call it a recursive function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Base case: A recursive function must converge to the base case in order to terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the uses of recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two main uses of recursion. \n",
    " * The first is when recursion is used as a technique in which a function makes one or more calls to itself. \n",
    " * The second is when a data structure uses smaller instances of the exact same type of data structure when it represents itself. You will learn about this in C S 3B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion actually occurs in the real world, such as fractal patterns seen in plants!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion provides a powerful alternative for performing repetitions of tasks in which a loop is not ideal. Most modern programming languages support recursion and recursion serves as a great tool for building out particular data structures."
